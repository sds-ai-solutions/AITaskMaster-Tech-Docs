# **AITaskMaster Technical Setup**
Great! Now that we've defined the scope of AITaskMaster, let's set up the technical environment. Our AI will suggest optimal choices based on your project requirements.

> **Server Type:**
> Physical Server (as per your preference)
>> AI Suggestion: A physical server with 16GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, and 1TB SSD should be sufficient for your initial user base.

> **Operating System:**
> Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
>> AI Suggestion: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS offers a good balance of stability and up-to-date packages for your AI-driven application.

> **Web Server:**
> Nginx
>> AI Suggestion: Nginx is recommended for its high performance and low resource usage, ideal for AI applications.

> **Database:**
> PostgreSQL
>> AI Suggestion: PostgreSQL is well-suited for your project due to its robustness and support for complex queries, which will be useful for AI-driven task management.

> **Backend Language:**
> Python (FastAPI)
>> AI Suggestion: Python with FastAPI is ideal for AI integration and offers high performance for asyncio operations.

> **Frontend Framework:**
> Vue.js
>> AI Suggestion: Vue.js provides a gentle learning curve and efficient performance, suitable for your project's dynamic UI requirements.

> **AI Framework:**
> TensorFlow
>> AI Suggestion: TensorFlow offers a wide range of tools and a large community, beneficial for implementing your AI-driven features.

## **Initial Project Structure**

``` { .yaml .annotate }
AITaskMaster/
├── backend/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── routers/
│   │   └── services/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── requirements.txt
├── frontend/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── views/
│   │   ├── App.vue
│   │   └── main.js
│   └── package.json
├── ai/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── data/
│   └── train.py
└── docker-compose.yml
```

This structure separates concerns between backend, frontend, and AI components, allowing for easier development and scaling.

## **Next Steps**
1. Set up version control (Git) and create a repository
2. Initialize the project structure
3. Set up the development environment with Docker
4. Implement basic backend API endpoints
5. Create frontend skeleton with Vue.js
6. Begin AI model development for task prioritization

Once you confirm these settings, we'll generate a custom development environment and provide you with step-by-step instructions to get your AITaskMaster project up and running.
